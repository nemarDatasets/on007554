# Multimodal EEG-fNIRS-physio dataset during hierarchical cognitive-motor tasks

This repository contains a raw multimodal dataset acquired in healthy adults performing a hierarchy of cognitive, motor, and combined cognitive-motor tasks. Data include neurophysiological (EEG, fNIRS), physiological (ECG and EMG), behavioral (push-button, torque), and subjective measures (sleepiness and cognitive load ratings), organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS).

The dataset is described in detail in a submitted data paper.

## 1. Dataset overview

- **Participants**  
  - 30 right-handed healthy adults (12 males, 18 females)  
  - BIDS IDs: `sub-001` to `sub-030`  
  - One participant (`sub-008`) has incomplete sessions; see `participants.tsv` for details.

- **Sessions**  
  - Three recording sessions per participant: `ses-01`, `ses-02`, `ses-03`  
  - Approximate duration: 30 minutes per session (about 90 minutes total per participant)  
  - All sessions took place in a quiet, dimly lit room with participants seated in a Biodex chair.

- **Modalities**  
  - EEG (32 channels, 10-20 system)  
  - fNIRS (prefrontal and sensorimotor montages)  
  - ECG (Delsys Trigno)  
  - Biodex torque and kinematic measures  
  - Push-button responses  
  - Phenotypic / subjective measures (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, cognitive load ratings, demographics, handedness)

- **Tasks (7 total)**  
  1. Mental arithmetic (MA)  
  2. N-back (NB, 2-back, auditory)  
  3. Motor imagery (MI)  
  4. Passive motor (Pass-Mot, Biodex-driven arm movement)  
  5. Active motor (Act-Mot, voluntary movement with Biodex)  
  6. N-back arithmetic (NB-MA, combined N-back and mental arithmetic)  
  7. Full task (NB-MA-Act-Mot, combined cognitive-motor condition)

All recordings shared here are **raw exports** from the acquisition systems with no offline preprocessing applied.

## 2. Experimental paradigm

Each participant performed the seven tasks within each session. Tasks were presented in random order, with:

- Task duration: 3 minutes per task  
- Inter-task rest: 30 seconds  
- Stimuli: auditory digits (0-9) and beeps, delivered via MATLAB/Psychtoolbox

Brief task descriptions:

- **MA (Mental arithmetic)**  
  Auditory digits (0-9). On each trial, participants add or subtract numbers so that the result stays in the 0-9 range.  
  - 72 events per task  
  - Event duration: 1.5 s  
  - Inter-event interval: 2.5 s

- **NB (N-back, 2-back)**  
  Auditory digits (0-9). Participants press a button when the current digit matches the digit presented two trials earlier.  
  - 72 events total, 18 targets  
  - Event duration: 0.5 s  
  - Inter-event interval: 1.5 s

- **MI (Motor imagery)**  
  Participants imagine moving the right arm (no actual movement) when they hear a beep.  
  - 18 targets  
  - Inter-target interval: 10 ± 3 s

- **Pass-Mot (Passive motor)**  
  The participant’s right arm is moved by the Biodex device (external and internal rotation, 60° range).  
  - Movement duration: 2 s  
  - 18 movements per task  
  - Inter-movement interval: 10 ± 3 s

- **Act-Mot (Active motor)**  
  Participants actively move the robotic arm in response to beeps.  
  - 18 movements per task  
  - Inter-target interval: 10 ± 3 s

- **NB-MA (N-back arithmetic)**  
  Participants press a button when the running sum of the last digits corresponds to the 2-back condition (combined N-back and arithmetic).  
  - 72 events total, 18 targets  
  - Event duration: 1.5 s  
  - Inter-event interval: 2.5 s

- **Full task (NB-MA-Act-Mot)**  
  Same cognitive demands as NB-MA, but participants move their arm (instead of pressing a button) when the NB-MA condition is met.  
  - 72 events total, 18 targets  
  - Event duration: 1.5 s  
  - Inter-event interval: 2.5 s

Subjective ratings:

- Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) before each session  
- Mental load ratings after each task (9-point Likert and visual analogue scale)
